/// @title EmptyKeyDeploySuites
/// A declaration whose CANDIDATE is keyed on the empty string — the value an
/// unset `DEPLOYMENT_SUITE` arrives at `suiteByName` as.
///
/// Unique, anchored to source and correctly pinned; the key is the only thing
/// wrong with it, so nothing else in the registry can be what refuses it.
///
/// The empty key sits SECOND, behind a released suite that is spelled properly,
/// for two reasons. A check that only ever looked at the first entry answers
/// this declaration as if it were fine, and the position the refusal reports is
/// the only handle on which entry is at fault when the key itself is empty.
///
/// `MockDeployableV2` rather than the registry a second time: this is the
/// contract the empty key would select, and it exists on no chain, so a reader
/// of this fixture can see that the suite an unset variable reaches is a real
/// deployable one and not a harmless duplicate of the one beside it.
