# rain.deploy

Tooling to deploy Solidity contracts deterministically across EVM networks via
the Zoltu deployment proxy.

Fundamentally Rain code is EVM-compatible and permissionlessly deployable
anywhere, but only a curated subset of networks are active deploy targets for
the Rain organisation. This library provides shared infrastructure for that
subset.

It answers:

- Are the dependencies of the current deployment available on this network?
- Does this deployment match other deployments on other networks?
- Have I deployed successfully to all expected networks?
- How do I track deployments over time and share addresses with other people?
- How do I ensure deployed code is bytecode-equivalent to local compilations?

Approach:

- Zoltu deterministic deployment proxy: same address on every supported network.
- Caller-provided supported-network and dependency lists.
- Hard guards against deploying to networks where dependencies are missing.
- Pre-calculated addresses asserted post-deploy: silent failures fail loudly.
- Bytecode integrity checks (e.g. via the Rain Extrospection lib) supported
  post-deploy.

## Install

Via [soldeer](https://soldeer.xyz):

```sh
forge soldeer install rain-deploy~<version>
```

## Develop

This repo uses [nix](https://nixos.org/download.html). The default shell is the
slim `sol-shell` from [rainix](https://github.com/rainlanguage/rainix).

```sh
nix develop          # enter the shell
forge soldeer install # install deps declared in foundry.toml
forge test
```

Tasks:

- `rainix-sol-test` — `forge test`
- `rainix-sol-static` — slither
- `rainix-sol-legal` — `reuse lint`

Use the nix-pinned `forge` for all development.

## Publish

Tag `v<x.y.z>` on `main`. The
[`Publish to Soldeer`](.github/workflows/publish-soldeer.yaml) wrapper delegates
to rainix's reusable workflow, which derives the package name from the repo name
(`rain.deploy` → `rain-deploy`).
